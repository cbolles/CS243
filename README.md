For editing files, I recommend using Vim. Vim is really powerful and very common among
the more "hardcore" developers. I will be writing (most) things in Vim.

The benefit of using Vim is that out of the box it has no autocomplete and code formatting
which means you have to learn how to write good c code on your own, like you will have to
on the final.

Here are some resources you can use to learn/get better with Vim.

You will quickly start to find switching between ssh sessions painful when you need to
access multiple files at once. I suggest using Tmux if you are feeling comfortable with
learning a new tool.

Full disclosure, this is completely optional and not meant to confuse you. If tmux isn't
making sense to you, don't let it confuse you.

Tmux lets you move between windows and panes from the command line so that you can work on
multiple things at once without having to close and reopen things

all lab machines. Don't try to install it again
