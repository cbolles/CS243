# <a name="aboutme"></a>About Me
My name is Collin Bolles. I am a second year CS student at RIT. I am currently the
treasurer for Engineers for a Sustainable World and a member of the firmware team on the
Electric Vehicle Team. Love to read, especially science-fiction and fantasy, currently
looking for a new book series. I love learning new things about just about anything.

# <a name="usingrepository"></a>How to Use This Repository
The goal of this repository is to provide you with examples, practice problems, and
resources to make the class easier. I will not be putting up solutions or code snippets
that you can use in your homework assignments. Doing so is against the
[RIT Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/d080) 
and can have serious consequences.

Use the tools in here to help deepen your understanding, fill in any gaps, and practice
what you have learned. Throughout the year I will update the repository with examples
and practice problems that you can use.

## <a name="vim"></a>Vim
For editing files, I recommend using Vim. Vim is really powerful and very common among
the more "hardcore" developers. I will be writing (most) things in Vim.

The benefit of using Vim is that out of the box it has no autocomplete and code formatting
which means you have to learn how to write good c code on your own, like you will have to
on the final.

Here are some resources you can use to learn/get better with Vim.

## <a name="tmux"></a>Tmux
You will quickly start to find switching between ssh sessions painful when you need to
access multiple files at once. I suggest using Tmux if you are feeling comfortable with
learning a new tool.

Full disclosure, this is completely optional and not meant to confuse you. If tmux isn't
making sense to you, don't let it confuse you.

Tmux lets you move between windows and panes from the command line so that you can work on
multiple things at once without having to close and reopen things

Here are some cheat sheets and ways to learn tmux. Note tmux is installed by default on 
all lab machines. Don't try to install it again
